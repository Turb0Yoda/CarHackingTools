Raspberry Pi Twist.
------------
This is my fork of the Carhacking.tools script to work on a Raspberry Pi 3B running Ubuntu MATE. I had some issues with the install and decided to rework the script a little bit. Below is the original post.


# CarHacking.Tools
[CarHacking.Tools](CarHacking.Tools) is a scripts collection of scripts to help jump start car research (and hacking?). All the scripts are designed to run on [Ubuntu 18.04](ubuntu.com).

# How To Install

### Install Virtual Machine

An OVA is available on [CarHacking.Tools](CarHacking.Tools) to download.

Download [CHV BETA OVA](https://carhacking.tools/install/beta/CarHackingToolsCHVBeta.ova) Here.

```
Notes:  
VMWare Fusion Works Better Than Virtual Box
Stand Alone Hardware Is Best.
```

## Warning
I likely don't know what I am doing and this could be done faster, better and simpler some other way. These scripts could also break your car (seriously) and make you cry.
